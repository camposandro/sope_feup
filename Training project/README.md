# simgrep

*simgrep* is a simple implementation of the well-known **"grep"** command used in linux-based systems. It is then used to search for entries (files/folders) within a chosen directory, and the command's flags ("-i", "-l", "-n", "-c", "-w", "-r") enable the customization of that searching process.
